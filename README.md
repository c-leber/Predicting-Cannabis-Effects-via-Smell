# Predicting Cannabis Effects via Smell
#### supervised learning | classification | probablistic imputation | cross-validation | hyperparamater tuning
Building classifiers with sci-kit learn to predict the effects of cannabis strains based on their aromas and flavors.

See my initial report and code for model building [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/c-leber/Predicting-Cannabis-Effects-via-Smell/blob/main/Code_and_Report.ipynb)
